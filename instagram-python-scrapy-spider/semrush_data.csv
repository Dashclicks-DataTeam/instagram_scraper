Smart, huh?

1️⃣ For small business owners, Barnacle SEO is mainly used on third-party local listing websites. A common example in a lot of industries would be Yelp. Other industries have other big players—so step one would be to identify them.

Pro tip: use our Keyword Overview Tool to verify what third-party websites are ranking for your desired keyword. 

2️⃣ Each third-party will have its own ranking system/algorithm. Having a robust profile is likely going to help your listing rank higher on their internal search results (the pages that are ranking for your top keywords). Here’s a standard checklist that could be applied to most third-party listings:

✔️Do we already have a listing? If not, start the process to verify one.
✔️Is the business information correct? Are all available fields filled out? 
✔️Do we have the appropriate primary category chosen?
✔️What additional categories can/should we add?
✔️Are the listing photos great at conveying the service offering?
✔️Are there any available CTAs available for free or a reasonable fee? 
✔️How many reviews does the listing have? 
✔️Where do we currently rank on the results page that ranks well organically?
✔️Outside of sponsored ads at the top, what are the key differences between these listings and ours?

Another ‘potential’ side effect of ranking well on these sites is the theory that it could also help your regular organic rankings.

As search engine bots crawl the page, listings, and thereby, the nofollowed (now a hint) links on the listing could pass some relevance. This is nearly impossible to test but, theoretically, it makes sense. The higher up your ‘link’ is on a page, the more link ‘equity’ you would get compared to your competitors.

Barnacle SEO can be a great strategy, although it should never be the only strategy you have in place. Like your review building strategy, it’s a good idea to diversify your efforts.

Without KPIs, you will not be able to effectively track your campaign's progress and ensure that your efforts are paying off or determine if you are on the right track towards business success.

It is no hidden secret that SEO takes time to deliver results and returns, but by setting KPIs, you can be in a better position to demonstrate the impact that your strategy is having on business.

They can also help you to manage expectations with other stakeholders. SEO KPIs should form the basis of your strategy and act as a way to both measure and report on success and progression, but you need to know what you should be measuring 💡

The H1 is an HTML tag that indicates the main heading on a webpage. Usually, it is used to mark up your content's main headline, and it's typically the first visible header on your page. As simple as that!

H1 is often confused with the page title/the <head> element of HTML code. Let us clarify it:

The page title/the <head>: 
-  Is shown in the browser window and search results snippet 
-  Is defined in the HTML <head> section

The H1 tag:
- Is shown on the page itself
- Is a part of the <body> of a page.

If you need to add more creativity to your article, there’s a little more room in the H1 tag than in the title tag. Here’s what you need to consider when writing your H1 heading: 

✏️ Create a unique H1. This will help prevent visitors from getting lost between similar pages on your site.

✏️ Use words like 'how', 'why', 'what', and 'where'. This way, you help people understand what they will find on the page below – guides and how-to articles also drive 2x more traffic than other types.

✏️ Use numbers like 'top 10', '5 best', 'N things…', etc. Articles with list headlines get 2x more traffic and 2x more social shares than other types.

✏️ Describe what is discussed in the text body. The H1 of the page should describe the content; otherwise, Google regards the discrepancy as low content quality.

Pro tip: Our Topic Research can help you quickly find the most resonating headlines. After entering a topic, you’ll instantly see popular headlines with the highest amount of backlinks and social engagement.

🔗Internal links are those that point from one page to another on your site. External links, by contrast, are ones that point to a page on another domain 🔗

Do internal links help SEO? The short answer is ‘yes’. We can break its benefits down into three main points:

💡 Internal links help search engines understand your site’s structure and help search engines find and index the pages on your site.
💡 The right internal linking strategy helps to pass authority between pages on your site and ultimately improve rankings.
💡 Internal linking is also a great way to improve your user experience (UX) by helping your visitors find more interesting content. 

A solid internal linking strategy can help your content rank higher on Google, whether it is new or old.

It doesn’t need to be an overly complex approach either, since, unlike earning external links, you are in full control of every step of the process. With the right data, tools, and planning, you can intuitively roll out a quick strategy that can have big results 🏆

Now it’s time to gear up for 2021 🤓 We’ve outlined the most important SEO trends you should know for 2021!

🤖 Artificial Intelligence will play a larger role in SEO.
Unveiled a few years back, the algorithm—called RankBrain—plays an important role in Google’s ranking factors for SERPs results. 

The big question is, how do you optimize your SEO for RankBrain? While the search engine giant won’t share details, experts believe that user experience signals are the primary determinant. These could include factors from click-through rate to time spent on page. You need to captivate and engage readers with useful, well-organized content.

🎙️ Voice Search will impact search queries.
Thanks to innovations like Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri, voice search technology has come a long way. As technology has gotten better, it’s also gotten more popular.

To optimize for voice search, consider your keywords. Identify longer phrases that people use in everyday conversation. Voice searches tend to do better with longer, more natural-sounding phrasing. 

📱 Mobile-Friendliness will impact search rankings.
In 2019, Google rolled out mobile-first indexing, meaning the search engine looks primarily at the mobile version of a website, considering this the “primary” version instead of the desktop version. 

This change makes sense, given that nearly 73% of internet users will access the internet solely via mobile devices by 2025. 

— Check how effective your mobile site is with Google’s free mobile-friendly test.
— Take a peek at the “mobile usability” report in Google Search Console.
— To make sure your page is user-friendly, you have to ensure that Google can crawl your URLs, so make sure you don’t have a “disallow directive” in place. 
— Beware that Googlebot won’t load content requiring user interactions, like clicking or swiping.
— Make sure Google can see this so-called lazy-loaded content. Finally, ensure you use the same meta robots tags on the desktop and mobile sites.

Something that other people will want to link to simply because of how great it is. 

The Skyscraper Technique is an approach that can be used to earn quality editorially placed links at scale, using insights from other top-performing content assets to inform your own approach.

It's a link building tactic that was devised by @briandean of Backlinko as a way to create engaging content that will help you to earn quality editorial links.

And the technique sits on the foundation of 3 core principles:

🏙️ Find popular content that has been linked to from other sites.
You can find top-performing pieces of content by heading to Google and searching for your main target keywords that you are trying to rank for. Use our Backlink Analytics tool to check how many links has a certain piece of content earned. 

🏙️ Create a better piece of content on the same topic and publish it on your own site.
Create a long-form piece of content, go deeper into the topic, and focus on the details people are searching for, add high-quality visuals.

🏙️ Promote your content to the right people and let them know it exists.
Where the Skyscraper Technique is different from other outreach-led link building tactics is that the first step of promotion is to make sure you are promoting to people who have already linked out to similar content to yours. 

It is a common misconception that everything you do has to be totally innovative. 

The Skyscraper Technique is a great way to earn quality links by following a proven process, and it is a tactic that can scale up to drive success. Combining great content with great links remains a recipe for success, and it is a tactic that, when done properly, is a force to be reckoned with 💡

Check out these highlights of the essential Google SEO success factors to understand how to create a website that will succeed.

🚀 High-Quality Content
Your main goal is to deliver value to your readers. To start, ensure every page includes at least 300 words of original content. Content should be broken into shorter chunks, for instance, with H2 subheadings, so it’s easy to scan. 

🚀 On-Page SEO
Content doesn’t just need to be high-quality. It also needs to be optimized for search engines. Start with this basic checklist for on-page SEO:
— Choose one primary keyword for the page and 3-4 related ones.
— Include the primary keyword in your URL, title tag, meta description, and H1.
— Make sure internal links use effective anchor text.
— Include at least one image. 

🚀 Effective Keywords
Your content should include target keywords—basically, what words or phrases users might look for that would ideally lead them to your page. Keywords tell the search engine what your page is about.

🚀 Useful Backlinks
 These are links on other websites that direct people to your site. When your site is consistently referred to by other quality websites, Google recognizes that it’s trusted. Such backlinks are even more useful if the linking website is trustworthy.

 🚀 Security
To ensure your website is secure, use HTTPS encryption. This gives your site SSL certificates, creating a secure connection between your platform and your end-users and protects information that the users might provide to the site, such as passwords.

🚀Crawlability
Crawlability ensures that search engines can find your site. Make it as easy as possible for search engine bots to crawl, index, and understand the type of content you provide.

🚀 Load Speed
Top-ranking Google sites average a load time of fewer than 3 seconds. According to Google webmasters, Google aims for less than a half-second.

🚀 Mobile-Friendliness
You want to create a website that offers a user-friendly experience for both desktop and mobile users—aim for a responsive design, and nix text-blocking ads and pop-ups. Keep it simple.

But what are the metrics that indicate interaction time? ? Bounce Rate, Time on Page, Dwell time are some of the metrics that get referenced a lot for these purposes. 

All three of these are related to the amount of time users spend on your website.  But what is the actual difference among them? 🤯

Check out this simple breakdown to reduce the confusion:

⏱️ Dwell time: Dwell time is the amount of time that goes by from the moment a user clicks on a search result to the moment they return to the search engine results pages (SERPs). It’s a measurement of a user’s dwelling time—how much time they linger on a page, beginning and ending with the SERPs. 

⏱️ Time on page: This refers to how much time a user spends on a page before navigating elsewhere. That means anywhere else. They could go to another page on your website, to an external link in your content, or even to the SERPs. Time on page is calculated based on two clicks—the click that brings the user to the webpage in question and the click that brings the user away from that page.

⏱️ Bounce rate: If a visitor only visits one page on your website and leaves, this is referred to as a single-page session. The bounce rate consists of a website’s percentage of single-page sessions. The bounce rate can result from a person going back to the SERPs or closing the page. Whether they spend one second or one hour on the page, it will still qualify as a bounce.

Now, if the time on page is low, it could mean that the user got the answer they needed quickly and, therefore, left the website quickly. The same holds true of the bounce rate: After a quick scan, the user may have gotten the details they needed and closed the window.

Dwell time is more telling, however. If the user looked at a webpage briefly and went back to the SERPs, this suggests that the webpage they viewed didn’t give them the information they needed. In short, the user wasn’t satisfied with what they got.

The Nielsen Norman Group study found that 20% of purchase failures are potentially a result of misleading or even missing product information. That's a lot of sales (read: profit) lost, right? 💸

Product descriptions are a key part of running a successful eCommerce business and a good description is your chance to overcome any misgivings your customers may have about spending money.

The heart of how you do this is by convincing the reader that your product offers real value to them in a way that resonates 🙌

Anyone can start writing good product descriptions with practice, and these tips will help you!

Let's run a search for ""boy who lives in a cupboard under the stairs."" Of course, Google knows that you mean Harry Potter even when you didn't mention his name. Pure magic, huh? ✨ Actually not. It's a semantic search technology merit.

Semantic search was created to better understand search intent through a search query's contextual meaning.

It drives an enhanced level of understanding behind the meaning of search queries (let's not forget that 15% of searches have never been made before☝️), returning results that are both more relevant but also personalized.

But how does it work? This visual breaks down what is happening when you run this search!

Why is it important? SEOs need to approach optimizing for semantic search, this means:

💡 Thinking about topics, not just keywords. 

💡 Understanding that high-volume keywords matter less than they once did and that long-tail, related keywords and quality content matter more than ever. 

💡 There is a distinct need to analyze and understand search intent before creating content. There is also a need to format your content to fit the query type and the SERP features you may want to win. 

💡 That structured data is a must. 

💡 You should be thinking about how you can create a Knowledge Graph entity.

Think about how your customers are searching for your products, services, and their search intent. Then place this as your primary focus.

Marketing FOMO during these times is STRONG 🤯

The truth is that if everything seems important, nothing really is. That’s why you need a smart way to decide what to focus on first 💡

We’ll share some simple steps that we use here at SEMrush to help you remove confusion from what to work on next.

✔️ Step 1: Collect all your ideas/projects/tasks you have & write them on sticky notes! It could be anything—the ideas you brainstormed with your team or even product feedback from your customers.

✔️ Step 2: Grab a piece of paper or create a Miro board & plot out a simple XY graph where one axis stands for complexity and the other for impact on your project. 

✔️ Step 3: Place your sticky notes filled with ideas on the chart by asking two simple questions, ""How difficult will it be to accomplish this task/idea?"" and ""What impact on your project could it have on a scale of 0 to 10?""

✔️Step 4: When all the ideas are in their place, check our graphic above to see which tasks you should prioritize and which you can postpone!

This simple decision-making framework will help you to confidently say “yes” and “no” to different marketing ideas/projects and allocate your resources on what matters the most!

Not exactly. Repurposing content is a smart way to use your previous content pieces and revitalize them so they work harder for your business ♻️

When you repurpose your content you can get multiple pieces of content out of just one. It can save your time = resources = money 💸 

Below you can find some content repurpose ideas that worked well for us:

💡Turn a text blog post into an infographic, SlideShare presentation or a video.
💡Segment a long article or video into shorter pieces that you can publish as a series.
💡Combine short content pieces to create a white paper or a long-read article.
💡Create social snippets & informative images with numbers, quotes, highlights from the post and share multiple times across your social media channels
💡Host a webinar and turn the transcription into a blog post.
💡Turn your blog post into a series of educational newsletters.
💡Turn your long read pillar post into an ebook and gate it.

We asked our community to share the biggest SMBs marketing challenges they are now facing. Here are the results! ☝️

The top-1 challenge that 67.4% of respondents are facing right now is, of course, limited marketing budget 💰 While tight marketing budgets can be difficult to work with, there are steps you can take to stretch your budget further. These include the following:

✔️ Invest intelligently in paid ad spend. If you’re putting your money exactly where it needs to be, reducing ad spend waste, you’ll see more of an impact. Start by defining your overall digital marketing objectives, and then decide which of the paid advertising options will help you to achieve your goals. Select 2-3 paid traffic sources that make the most sense for your goals and start experimenting.

✔️ Invest in what’s already working. If you’re on a tighter-than-normal budget, it’s typically a good call to go all-in on what you know is performing. This prevents the need to spend exorbitant portions of ad spend on split tests or platforms that may not work for you.

✔️ Look for your competition’s best-performing channels. If you want to break out into new channels, looking at your competitor’s marketing mix with SEMrush’s Traffic Analytics tool can be a safe bet. This can help you see what’s working for them, and you can test out the platforms with less risk.

Mobile isn't going anywhere, and, as of 2019, a staggering 63% of US search traffic originated from a mobile device. This means that a website's mobile version is the one that should take preference, and Google acknowledges this with mobile-first indexing.

By March 2021, Google will have switched ALL websites from desktop-first to mobile-first indexing, having been through a transitional period of moving sites over when their systems recognized that they were ready to do so. 

If you are still one of the few businesses that don't have a mobile-friendly website (sadly, there are still a few of these that exist), you can expect to see a negative impact on your search rankings across both mobile and desktop searches 📉

Here are some things you need to know about mobile-first indexing 👇

💡 You сan сheck if your site is on Mobile-First Indexing.
Load up Google Search Console → run a URL inspection for one of your site's pages → you will then see the ""coverage"" results for your inputted URL →  if you see ""Googlebot smartphone""in the ""crawled as"" field, your site is mobile-first.

💡 You need to know that once you have been moved over to mobile-first indexing, there is no going back.  And this means that you absolutely must be thinking mobile-first when designing and developing your site, planning content, and considering how your site displays to users on mobile devices.

💡 You can easily and quickly test your website's mobile-friendliness using Google's mobile-friendly test tool.

💡 There is a whole guide available on Mobile-first indexing best practices, published by #Google. This is a great reference point for any marketer trying to get their head around mobile-first indexing:
✔️ Make sure that Googlebot can access and render your content
✔️ Make sure that content is the same on desktop and mobile
✔️ Check your structured data
✔️ Put the same metadata on both versions of your site
✔️ Check the placement of your ads
✔️ Troubleshoot mobile-first issues.

Are you ready for the mobile-first indexing?

Here's how👇

Usually, the best way to plan out effective URLs is to keep in mind the big picture of your website. The structure of your site folders and categories will eventually influence your future URLs.

🔗 Tip 1: Plan your categories based on search
To make your URLs appeal more to searchers, they should be named with your keywords in mind. This means asking yourself important questions about the main categories on your website. When judging your categories, you should ask yourself:

🤔 Are they directly correlating to your business’ products/services?
🤔 Do they relate to popular searches?
🤔 What phrases are people using to search for your competitor’s services?

If you know how people search for your services, you can structure your categories and URLs to target common search language accordingly.

🔗 Tip 2: Keep it simple
With URLs, the simpler the better. This starts with simple categories but continues with deeper pages on your site. Simple often times means short, and shorter URLs are easier to read and potentially less confusing. If you can read the URL out loud, then it's probably simple enough for strangers to read quickly and understand. 

According to Brian Dean and John Lincoln, SEO friendly URLs should have 1-2 target keywords and 1-2 folders. Anything more can become confusing or hard to read. Therefore, you should create folders should with descriptive names and avoid “dynamic URLs,” or URLs with long strings of numbers at the end, whenever possible. 

So, let’s sum things up. SEO-friendly URLs Will:
🔗 Include your keyword
🔗 Be descriptive and meaningful
🔗Easy to read
🔗 Use relevant categories/subfolders
🔗 Contain around 3 to 5 words if possible

Many brands like the idea of being able to outsource content writing, but some struggle to implement the process for a number of reasons. 

We conducted our survey to find out the pros and cons of content outsourcing 👇

The most common reasons to outsource content writing are: 

✔️ It saves time. Not everyone has the ability to consistently produce and publish new content, which 69% cited as the reason they outsource content (lack of time for writing). 
✔️ Lack of copywriting skills and the expertise needed to create SEO-optimized content, which 34% of our survey respondents cited as the reason they outsource.
✔️ 33% of respondents said they have in-house writers, but needed to outsource to scale. 

We found that there were some common bottlenecks that we saw over and over that made the outsourcing process more difficult or ineffective:

💡 Outsource writers have a lack of understanding of brand voice or business values. This is something that 69% of respondents who outsource content face.
💡 28% of respondents struggled with choosing topics and content tasks. Many marketers feel overwhelmed trying to develop or select topics, or to create content tasks and assignments for freelancers.
💡 24% of our survey participants said the slow turnaround was their biggest challenge with outsourcing content. 

Do you outsource content writing? Why or why not? We are curious to hear your opinion!

The People Also Ask feature has become an important facet of SEO and content strategies over the past few years. Do you know 

Our team examined 1,000,000 keywords of US desktop results to provide unique insights into the changing landscape of Google search features.

Here's what we found:

💡 PAA boxes are present in almost half of all searches within our 1,000,000 keyword dataset and are continuing to grow.

💡 Google is using PAA at least in part for query refinement, giving websites the opportunity for first-page visibility on search terms that were previously too broad to target.

💡 A PAA SEO strategy is applicable to almost all sectors (industry-specific breakdowns can give you a guide to how much of your overall effort should go into PAA optimization).

💡 There are opportunities and risks for big brands to control answers where PAA questions are shown on branded search terms.

💡 Unlike featured snippets, it is possible to both appear in a PAA box and hold a standard organic ranking on page 1 of Google.

💡 75% of the time a PAA result appears, it is within the top 3 results in Google, providing a good chance of high visibility.

💡 Question terms on average will generate PAA 86% of the time.

Surprising, isn't it? 

But we all know that if you’re a content marketing manager at some point you’re going to be asked to justify all of the hard work you do.

The best way to do so is with an actual ROI calculation 💵 ⚖️ Content marketing ROI is a percentage that shows how much revenue you gained from content marketing in comparison to what you spent.

In this picture, we've shown a very simple and popular formula for calculating it. To measure it right, you have to know, in as much detail as possible, what are the R and the I of your content. And here is where your headache usually starts 🤯

There are many elements that go into both the return and the investment of a content marketing campaign:

▶️ Investment: take a look at all of the funds you’re attributing to making your campaign a success:
→ Outsourced writers cost;
→ In-house efforts: editors, copywriters, designers' work;
→  Management;
→ Optimizing your content for SEO;
→ Promoting it via PPC/paid social, etc.

▶️ Return: this metric is tricky as you have to select your metrics with care for different goals and types of content marketing. For example:
→ Your ebook brought you 2,000 leads, and you managed to convert 2% of them to make a purchase that brought you $2,500.
→ You get 150 new subscribers per month from the podcast to your email newsletter. You know that 1% percent of subscribers to the email newsletter become customers. One customer brings you $15,000 on average during their customer lifecycle, and your profit margin averages 20%.

So, how do you know if it’s worth it? If you spend less on producing and promoting your content than you earn, then it’s definitely worth it.

Once you have ROI for each content initiative, you can think strategically about whether you want to spend your content marketing resources and how you should allocate your budget. 🤔

Think of it like planning your trip: how do you know if you’ve reached the final destination if you don't have one?

Let's talk about two popular goal-setting frameworks and how you can combine them to set smart goals for your teams and projects!

OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) is a goal-setting methodology that helps companies and teams to align goals. OKRs ensure everyone is working toward the same result. 
▶️ Objective—what do you want to accomplish?
▶️ Key result—how will you accomplish the objective?

Here's how to set them:
→ Set each goal as a challenge.
→ Define 3-4 key results by objective.
→ Measure your goals with a progress indicator of 0 to 100%.
→ Make your goals collaborative and transparent.
→ Assess goals according to new conditions.
→ Adjust a goal if it becomes irrelevant.

✅  Example:
O1: Increase Customer Engagement
K1: Get 100 new positive reviews on TrustPilot
K2: A new voting website feature is used 100 times

SMART, is a goal-setting approach allowing you to remove the “vague” factor from setting and reaching goals. It is a way to set parameters and remind team members that every goal they set should be: 

Specific—your goal should be aimed at improving a specific area. 
Measurable—the result should be quantitatively measurable. 
Achievable—it should be realistically achievable, given available resources.
Relevant—it should be relevant to your business.
Time-bound—you should specify when the result will be achieved.

Example:
❌ Increase website traffic.
✅ Increase homepage organic website traffic by 15% over the next 5 months.

Basically SMART is the ""spell-checker"" in the goal-setting world that helps you ensure that you correctly phrase your goals.

Combining these two concepts can help you make your goals clear and ensure that they really matter: use the OKR approach and set your key results using the SMART approach as a ""spell-checker""! 

How do you set goals for your projects?

🌲 The topics that evergreen content covers have a constant level of sustained interest—whatever the news, whatever the time of year, there are always people wanting to consume content around these topics. When a topic has an always-on level of interest, it is evergreen. 

There is often confusion surrounding what classes as evergreen content and what does not fall into this category, and when planning a content strategy, it is vital to effectively determine the type of content that you need to be producing to drive success. 

So to set the record straight, evergreen content is not:
❌News posts and articles
❌Product announcements
❌Statistics and trends that go out of date
❌Seasonal content (relating to Christmas, Easter, specific events, etc.)
❌Content about current trends

The most popular content formats that fall into this category include:
✔️ How-To Guides
✔️ Listicles
✔️ Top Tips
✔️ Informational Long-Form Guides
✔️ Cornerstone content
✔️ FAQs
✔️ Case Studies
✔️ Checklists
✔️ Testimonials

Remember, though, that these are simply formats. You then need to identify relevant evergreen topics in your industry and determine the most effective format to use. Ask yourself the question, ""do we expect the interest in this topic to drop off anytime soon?""

If the answer is no, there is an excellent chance it is an evergreen topic that can drive sustained results over time.

And the reality is that these aren't true, and they are also not untrue — if that makes sense? 🤔

Both short-form and long-form content have their place in a successful content marketing strategy, and both can be very powerful tools in your marketing toolbox. 

Let's first define what is the difference between those two formats:

✏️ Short-form content is typically considered to be content of fewer than 1,200 words in length. It is typically quick and easy to digest content that covers a specific area of a topic.

📝 Long-form content is typically more than 1,200 (sometimes 1,000) words. It is content that dives deep into a topic and covers it in great depth

Does the length of your content matter? This is a question that is commonly asked amongst SEOs and content marketers.

The simple answer to this is that yes, the length of your content does matter. But that shouldn't be interpreted as meaning that longer content is better because that is taking the answer out of context 

The length of content needs to be right to serve the purpose you are trying to serve and meet the objectives that you have set 💡 And this is why it is so important to understand how to choose the right format of content for different purposes, and to take time to understand the search intent of other similar content that performs.

According to multiple studies, in most cases, longer content performs better for organic search than short-form content. But that is not just because of the word count.

It is because many search queries require detailed results and content to cover a topic in great depth. This, in turn, demands long-form content to sufficiently offer the best results on the web. You must consider the length of your content in context, even when the purpose is to rank on the SERPs.

Don't focus on creating longer content; instead, focus your efforts on creating content that is the right length and format to meet your goals (and matches the search intent of search engine users).

While they are not the first thing most SEOs think about when auditing their sites and planning successful strategies, there are reasons why they should receive more attention.

▶️ Linking out to relevant content helps to strengthen the topical signals of your web pages and helps to add context for Google to understand your site better.

▶️ You are not going to cause problems by linking out, despite what some common myths might have you think. Use them to enhance your content, add depth to the topic, and strengthen topical signals.

▶️ When writing on the web, outbound links are how you should reference your sources. This is something that Google employees themselves have confirmed on multiple occasions.

🤔 Do Outbound Links Affect SEO?

This topic that has been debated by SEOs for a long time.

There is no getting away from the fact that linking out to authoritative sources can help to give context to your content and can also help users to trust your website's pages. As well as the fact that unnatural outbound links can harm your website's performance.

But some SEOs believe that outbound links can have a more significant impact than most would find, and this study from @rebootonline claims that ""external links remain a ranking factor and good SEO best practice."" The study states:

“We don’t know and have not proved how powerful outgoing links are in the grand scheme of things, but we have proved they do have a positive impact if used correctly.
More importantly, we disproved the old myth of Pagerank retention which in my opinion has done nothing but harm to the internet as a whole as webmasters try to keep the ‘link juice’ in house slowly eroding the building blocks of the web.”

It is safe to say that, while there is no confirmation on the specific extent of the impact that outbound links can have on a site's visibility, they are something that SEOs should be paying more attention to 🔗

That is what link bait can help you to do! When done right, link bait makes it easy to earn authority links at scale, and these links can have a huge impact on organic search visibility.

Link bait is an effective link building tactic for the simple reason that it is one of the few that you can use to earn authority links at scale, as well as one that you can scale.

Okay, but how do you create link bait content?

There are many different things that go into great link bait, but some of the most successful pieces launched by marketers share several common traits:

✔️ Appeal to a wide enough audience that they can earn links at scale from quality publications.
✔️ Can be cited by a journalist or content creator to back up stats, quotes, or comments that they include in their articles.
✔️ Elicit an emotional response by a reader.
✔️ Solves problems or answer questions.
✔️ May be controversial or hook into a hot topic that is being aggressively covered by the media.
✔️ Are executed in a way that linking to the content makes sense and needs to be in place to add value to an article.

High quality, link bait content that meets a need or provides value to a wide audience is what will help you earn the links you want; keep this in mind when creating content.

Why?

 🔗 They show trust
Google and other search engines use them as a way to understand the authority of a page. Think of them as the online reputation of a website, with a link from Website A to Website B being seen as a vote that it is a trustworthy source. If five people who didn’t know each other all recommended a particular restaurant as the best in your city, you would likely trust that you would be able to get a good meal there, as multiple individuals would all be vouching for it.

⭐ They demonstrate your popularity
This is how Google views backlinks as votes of popularity for a website or webpage, and there is a strong correlation between those with a higher number of links pointing to them and higher rankings.

It has been 15 years since Google introduced the rel=""nofollow"" option for bloggers that were struggling with people using comment spam to try and build links in the hope of ranking for specific keywords.

However, Google has introduced two similar types of attributes—sponsored and the UGC attribute. Just like the original nofollow attribute, these two will still highlight to Google that the link should not parse PageRank. However, the main difference is that the two new rel values will give a “hint” to Google about the link’s overall use and intent.

On the pictures above we explain how each attribute works. 

▶️ Why Not Just Stick With the Nofollow Attribute? 
👉 The new values will assist Google in designing a better-defined linking architecture against which unnatural linking patterns can be judged.
👉 The new attributes will also assist Google in an ongoing analysis of anchor text, specifically the relevance of the anchor text in relation to the destination content. 

▶️ Can I combine rel values to create dual-purpose links?

YES. Where a link is both sponsored and part of user-generated content, you may combine the sponsored attribute and the UGC attribute to create a tag that looks like this: rel=”sponsored ugc”. 

▶️ Do I have to stop using nofollow for sponsored links and UGC links?

NO. The use of the nofollow attribute to cover all cases of paid/sponsored and UGC links will continue to be supported going forward. 

▶️ Do I still have to highlight ads & sponsored links?

YES. Link schemes (where is a link is strategically used in an attempt to positively affect PageRank and the site’s position in SERPs) can incur punishments. Avoid action by flagging paid/sponsored links with either the ‘nofollow’ or the ‘sponsored’ attribute.

Here's a quick checklist that will help you to identify whether the link is of high-quality or a potentially a harmful one ✔️

If you want your link profile to be healthy, conduct regular backlink audits. It is the most effective way to proactively find backlink issues and areas of concern so you can take action to protect your rankings.

One way to judge the performance of any company is, of course, to compare it with other companies in a niche. This technique is commonly called “competitive benchmarking.” 

By benchmarking yourself against the industry and competitors, you will be able to get a clearer understanding of your market position and to uncover potential opportunities.

There are three types of competitive benchmarking:

🔍 Process benchmarking helps you understand your internal processes and increase their efficacy by examining how your competitors go about a given business process. 

🔍  Strategic benchmarking is aimed at comparing business models and approaches to amplify business strategies. 

🔍 Performance benchmarking is all about measuring strategy outcomes - from competitors’ traffic generation strategies to their social media performance.

Before getting started with competitive benchmarking, and even before identifying the competitors you are comparing your performance against, you have to think carefully about what metrics you are considering ☝️

On the picture we outlined the set of the most essential metrics & KPIs you should at when benchmarking against your competitors!

❓What is my IP?
❓What time is it?
❓How to tie a tie?
❓Where am I?
❓How many weeks in a year?

▶️ What does SMH mean?
▶️ How to make hand sanitizer?
▶️ How old is Danielle Cohn?
▶️ What is pansexual?
▶️ How did Cameron Boyce die?
▶️ How tall is Peppa Pig?

Another interesting query to note and one that is still trending from 2019 across all countries is ‘What is Keto diet’ - with over 280,000 searches globally. 

We also noticed a shift in behaviors as people moved away from weight watching to health and safety obsessing. 'What is Coronavirus?' is in the top list of questions, being asked in Google more than 300,000 times each month.

Essentially, backlinks should:
✅ Be editorially earned
✅ Come from topically relevant, authoritative websites

Topic clustering is an #SEO tactic that focuses on topics (as opposed to keywords) that:
▶️ Improve your website architecture;
▶️ Make it easier for Google to discover related content;
▶️ Boost your search engine visibility.

To recreate this model for your blog, you’ll need to publish:

🖊️ A ‘pillar’ page that covers a general topic, and usually targets a high-volume keyword (e.g. ‘SEO’); In our example, it is an overview of SEO that discusses Technical SEO, Local SEO, Google Algorithms, Best Practices, and Backlinks.

🖊️ Create content for ‘clusters’  that break down the individual subtopics on the pillar page (e.g. ‘What is local SEO’) and link those cluster pages back to the pillar page.

🖊️ Then follow the same logic to create secondary cluster pieces that cover different aspects of the cluster topic in more details (e.g. 'Best Local SEO tools')

Tip: Pillar pages tend to be more long-form, while clusters are often shorter, but the clusters include more details on a specific subtopic. Both pages can be useful to readers and can rank well. 

If one of your goals is to be an authority on a specific topic and everything related to it, pillar content and topic clusters are a great strategy. Pillar pages should be detailed, helpful, and provide evergreen information your readers need.

The organization behind the structure helps both readers and search engines see where your expertise lies, and the supporting content clusters can be helpful for E-A-T and YMYL. Pillar content and clusters are also often considered the foundational content every website needs to prove the brand is authoritative on a topic.

👥 A buyer persona is an abstract depiction of the ideal customer.

Buyer personas help marketers better understand their customers to unveil what it is that makes them tick and choose one brand or solution over another.

But how do marketers use these insights exactly?

✔️ Better customer segmentation: buyer personas can add essential details that will empower the marketing strategy and bring in more qualified leads.

✔️ Personalized brand experience: with deeper knowledge about the potential customer’s pain point, marketers can create more targeted messaging, more efficient content delivery, and tailored offerings.

✔️ Identifying where high-value leads are: the buyer persona profile should also mention where this particular crowd “hangs out” to provide insight into which channels and platforms to target with the highly focused content.

Here's a template you can use to identify your product buyer personas!

The words you choose for linking out and into your site matter and quite a lot! Those words are called anchor text, and Google’s algorithms pay more attention to them than newbies (and even some marketing veterans) realize.

In plain words, anchor is a text you click to move from one internet destination to another; it literally anchors two different locations on the internet together 🔗

The text you choose for anchors are important for a few reasons:

▶️ They tell your readers what to expect before they click the link. As Nielsen Norman Group explains, a link is a promise. Anchor words are THE promise about what is on the other side of the link, so they must be highly relevant.
▶️ They tell the Google algorithms what your content is about. Google’s algorithms use your anchor choices to make sure you are not engaging in spammy practices AND to understand the topics you are linking to in your copy. 

By optimizing—but not over-optimizing—your anchor words and learning the best practices, you can fine-tune your SEO and watch your rankings climb. If you break the rules, Google can penalize your site. (Not good.)

In this post we explore 10 types of anchor text and explain how they work!

✔️ Your budget and resources
✔️ Your industry
✔️ Your current performance

Deciding where best to invest your marketing budget can be a difficult task for business owners. So, the big question is: Is it better to use pay-per-click (PPC) to buy your way to the top of the search results or should you put your efforts into an organic (SEO) strategy?

🔎 SEO is not a quick fix. It takes time and presence in organic search isn't always something new site owners can wait on. When done properly, a well-optimized search engine strategy can help to achieve strong rankings and sustained results.

💸 Whereas a PPC campaign  can be set up within minutes once you understand how it all works. Unlike SEO, where there’s no payment  to start a campaign, you’ll need an initial budgetary investment to get started with PPC given that you'll be paying for ad clicks.

🤳 Similar to SEO, it takes time to develop your Social Media and PR strategy and presence, but those channels can contribute to both long-term and short-term results. In a short-term context, you can use these channels to manage your online reputation and distribute content right away. In a long-term context, you can use them to support lead generation activities, engage in online communities and build relationships.

There are no “bad” marketing channels, just poor planning and strategy. To save time and valuable resources approach each of the main marketing channels thoughtfully, with a timeline and make them work together.

If you want to leverage the power of voice search for your business you have to know how to optimize for it. But there is one important note — people use various devices for their voice search. We decided to study whether there are any differences in the search algorithms that are behind various voice assistants. For this purpose we:
 
✔️ tested  6 devices that run on Google, Siri, and Alexa voice-activated assistants;
✔️ asked 5,000 questions;
✔️ recorded the answers for each query from every device;
✔️ used the Keyword Magic tool to cross-match them against the search results users receive from a regular desktop search.
 
We analyzed the data and found some really unique insights about voice assistant algorithms [spoiler: they are drastically different], identified the ranking factors behind each of them, and derived a list of data-driven recommendations for optimizing for local business voice search.

🧩 Positioning Your Brand
A clearly defined brand and product positioning will help you to provide a consistent experience for your audience and to build the right image of your brand through all your Content Marketing channels.
The following questions will help you start brainstorming about your position in the market:
✔️Who are my existing and potential customers?What are they looking for?
✔️How do my top competitors market their brands? What makes it a better?
✔️What problems does my product help to solve?
✔️How can I highlight my brand’s personality?

🧩 Owned Media Value Proposition
To establish your brand as a credible content publisher, you need to define your owned media value proposition. 
✔️ What unique value do you provide to your audience with your content? 
✔️ How do you stand out from other content creators? 
✔️ Why should readers choose to follow your content channels?

Start researching your audience to identify the type of information they are looking for and their favorite resources. Then, analyze your competitors’ content strategies to find your editorial niche.

🧩 Business Case
Providing value to your audience is an integral part of a successful content strategy. But in addition to attracting new readers and followers, Content Marketing should drive your business forward.

Identify business goals that your company needs to achieve and figure out how Content Marketing will bring your business closer to those goals. How many resources do you need to invest in your content strategy and what results do you want to get from this?

🧩 Strategic Plan
A strategic plan should focus on your goals and how exactly you will achieve them. It will help you to think through each step of your content strategy. This plan should help you decide who you want to reach with your Content Marketing efforts, how you will deliver that content to them and, finally, how you will achieve and measure your targeted results.

But do you have an action plan to detect & prevent negative SEO? 😬
 
Negative SEO is any malicious practice aimed at sabotaging search rankings of a website...including yours or a client's.
 
Start with a Negative SEO detection & prevention plan:

✅ Set up security breach alerts in Google Search console & ensure everyone with access to the site is authorized

✅ Use tools like the SEMrush Backlink Audit tool to audit & monitor your backlink profile for toxic backlinks & for sudden increases or decrease.

✅ Disavow suspicious links.

✅ Monitor online reviews for legitimacy and timely report on fake reviews.

✅ Regularly check for indexed duplicate or scraped content.

✅ Track & monitor  your website’s Authority Score. 

As a digital marketer, it is just as important to stay up-to-date on what others can do to hinder your site's performance as it is for you to stay up-to-date on the latest strategies.

🔍On-Page SEO
🔍Off-Page SEO
🔍Technical SEO

But what is the difference between these? Quite simply, we can define these approaches as:

👉 On-page SEO covers the tactics that you use on your site that help search engines to better understand and rank your content. From creating great content on your site, optimizing title tags, meta tags, and H tags to internal linking, image optimization, and more — these all fall under on-page SEO.

👉 Off-page SEO includes those tactics that relate to activities carried out away from your own website. Link building is often considered to be the main off-page tactic, but this also includes tactics such as content marketing, social media, appearing on podcasts, landing reviews, building local citations, and more.

👉 Technical SEO covers those things that directly impact the indexing and crawling of your site by search engines. Some argue that this falls under on-page SEO. However, it is also widely considered a discipline in its own right: site speed optimization, structured data, canonicalization, hreflang, and more all class as technical SEO.

It’s easy to understand, as this determines how much (and if at all) the agency’s vision matches the brand’s needs.

Building a custom-for-them proposal for each client isn’t easy, here’s what Hannah Thorpe, Business Director at @foundonline, had to say:
 
""The digital strategy we introduce at pitch may be tweaked and changed over time, however the way we work and the experience our clients have are consistent so it’s essential for us that clients don’t just understand it, they buy into it.

For us, the pitch process is about connecting values, aspirations, and expertise – and presenting the people we believe are most suited to achieve the client’s goals 💡 One of our core business values is transparency - in ways of working, in communication, in processes - so sharing our ways of working helps both parties to ensure we’re a good match.""

A one-size-fits-all approach will not cut it for online ad campaigns, though, as each industry has its own peculiarities:

🛒 Health and Beauty and Home and Garden ads often highlight exclusivity factors with CTAs like “limited edition”; 

🛒 Quality messaging is a big deal for sectors like Pets (“vet recommended”) and Consumer Electronics (“trusted since”, “factory authorized”, “authorized dealer”); and

🛒 Sport and Outdoors and Fashion ads often feature urgent and novelty indicators in CTAs, with the likes of “new arrivals”, “shop latest”, and “shop new” present in 26% of all ads analyzed within these industries.

Save this checklist with the ready-to-use structure for a sales presentation, backed up by industry data and expert advice!

1️⃣ Start with a clear value proposition
In a nutshell, when people are thinking “well why them,” you have to have a good answer to give. To formulate it ask yourself these questions:
✔️How are you differentiating yourself from other agencies?
✔️What experience do you have that sets you apart? 
✔️Which specific services do you offer?

2️⃣ Provide industry benchmarks
Industry benchmarks, statistics, and any other relevant data are inherently valuable. Which, for example, would you find more appealing: ""everyone’s buying clothes online"" 👉 ""According to 
a Nielsen study, 72% of the online shoppers bought fashion category"". You see? 

3️⃣Show strengths and weaknesses through competitor analysis
When you conduct competitor research for your prospects, you’re giving them valuable information they may not have had the time, resources, or knowledge to gather themselves. 

4️⃣Provide an audit of a current strategy
Maintain a delicate balance between finding growth points and highlighting what’s working well 💡 If you go too far in explaining that everything is wrong, you risk facing a defensive reaction from the prospect.

5️⃣ Tailor a proposal to what prospects need 
This is where all your previous research comes into play, combining with your experience to offer great insights and actionable ideas.

6️⃣ Describe  the working process
There are plenty of ways you can share this information with your potential client. One option is to use timeline graphics to take clients step-by-step through the process, setting reasonable expectations.

7️⃣ Add relevant case studies 
Real-life examples are already considered a must, especially when these examples are relevant to the prospect’s industry and profile. Add them as a cherry at the top of your cake.

What structure do you use in your sales presentations for potential clients?

Audits help check multiple boxes in the prospect’s mind:
✔️It shows that you’ve taken time to understand their pains and problems
✔️It makes any further recommendations more grounded
✔️It shows that you have the experience needed to guide the client towards a successful strategy

Auditing a potential client is tricky, especially because it takes a significant amount of work and you could still end up with a defensive client. 

We asked @kenvvright, Co-Founder / Technical Director at @riseatseven agency to share his insights on how to do this well:

""An initial audit provides an opportunity for open, honest dialogue – in the overwhelming majority of cases, an audit will return some combination of positive and negative findings (i.e. it’s rarely all good or all bad) – but the degree to which information is shared and the way in which findings are presented speaks volumes about each group (the agency and the potential client). 

If a client withholds data or requests that a particular component of the audit be framed in a more favorable light, that should be a red flag to the agency 🚩; and likewise, if an agency insists that everything done previously is a failure, that’s also a red flag 🚩. 

It facilitates alignment on business goals, KPIs & strategic priorities moving forward – audits should create alignment between all parties on the goals for the partnership, the amount of work required, the outcomes produced by previous initiatives, and the KPIs against which performance will be evaluated. An audit should go beyond basic marketing metrics and include meaningful business KPIs (incremental profitability, new customers gained, reduction in churn, increase in LTV, etc.) – and if this isn’t possible, that should be communicated at the outset of the relationship.

A well-done audit provides insight into the strengths + weaknesses of all parties, uncovers latent issues, creates transparency, accountability and dialogue, and lays the foundation for a successful partnership moving forward.""

The coronavirus crisis has taken its toll on global digital ad spend. 

⬇️ Comparing YoY data for the months of the pandemic (March-June 2019 vs. 2020), we spotted that almost everyone, from small- to large-scale advertisers, has reduced online advertising budgets by 20% on average. 

⬇️ Initially, those spending over $1 million a month on online ads were more hesitant to make significant cuts, but by June 2020, all advertisers had started to show lower confidence in digital ad spend.

⬇️ With lower ad spend, the costs of online advertising are also on the decline. Due to the pandemic, most e-commerce sectors have witnessed a drop in the average cost per click (CPC), which could mean that advertisers can get more value out of each dollar they spend.

▶️ URL

Before anything else, your URL has to be descriptive and meaningful (please avoid weird numbers and random letter combinations!). And of course, the URL is a very good place for your keywords.

Don’t forget that in a year you may want to update your content (including the title), so make sure your URL is evergreen and can be later applied to slightly or even drastically different content. If you decide to change the URL, do not forget about redirection to avoid 404 mistakes.

Your URL length matters — it is best to keep it around 3 to 5 words long. Also, when it comes to URL structure, using underscores as word separators is not recommended.

▶️ Title

You surely understand the power of a good title — it's critical for attracting the user’s attention and increasing the page CTR. Users will see your title on the SERP, and if they don’t like it or don’t see what they need, they will most likely not click and read your article.

The title should be there not only for users but for crawlers as well. So make sure you have title tags on your page. Also notice that while your H1 tag and title should not necessarily be repeating each other, you would still want them to be related.

▶️ Meta Description

A meta description does not impact your search engine rankings in any way, but as I said earlier, you have to think about users as well. A well-written meta description will help them better understand what your article or page is about, and it helps with click-through-rates.

Also, you do not want to let Google choose the meta description for you. When it happens, you may find a random phrase from your page residing there that won’t help you with users. You also want to avoid duplicate meta descriptions across different pages.

Understanding the intent allows you to create the right format and come up with attractive headlines (and, of course, content) for your audience. 

This #infographic will help you to identify search intent for your keywords and decide on post types and headlines accordingly.

💡 To identify #SearchIntent for your own list of keywords, check for keyword modifiers (e.g. ‘how’, ‘review’, ‘price’), and type a keyword into the Google search bar to check for any SERP features such as:

▶️ Featured snippets may indicate informational intent;
▶️ People also ask may indicate informational intent;
▶️ Site links may indicate navigational intent;
▶️ Google Ads may indicate commercial or transactional intent
▶️ #Google Shopping ads may indicate commercial/transactional intent.

You should now decide how to deal with #keywords from your list that fall outside of your blog’s purpose, such as ensuring navigational keywords point to category pages or transactional keywords point to product pages.

❓ What to do next: Refer to the infographic to identify search intent for every keyword from your keyword list, and mark it with the appropriate journey stage.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, consumer interest in #OnlineShopping is on the rise for everything from daily necessities to more serious purchases, such as laptops. Offline shopping, of course, is a long way from returning to normal 🤷‍♂️

📙 SEMrush data gathered via Traffic Analytics show that global average monthly ecommerce traffic across all industries is around 17 billion. 

📙 Spikes in November and December are typically expected as consumers flock to online stores for the likes of Black Friday and Winter holiday promotions, but the recent pandemic has caused some unexpected changes in the ecommerce landscape. 

📙 Traffic spikes to ecommerce websites in springtime were larger than the traditional spikes we tend to see in November and December. Remarkably, the traffic only continued to grow in June 2020.

📙 Traffic growth remained consistent during the months of the pandemic (March - June 2020), with the average being 36% across all the ecommerce categories. Apart from general retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and eBay, the three categories of Home and Garden, Food and Groceries, and Sport and Outdoors are the ones showing the most significant growth in traffic during this time at 40-50% YoY.

Why?

 🔗 They show trust
Google and other search engines use them as a way to understand the authority of a page. Think of them as the online reputation of a website, with a link from Website A to Website B being seen as a vote that it is a trustworthy source. If five people who didn’t know each other all recommended a particular restaurant as the best in your city, you would likely trust that you would be able to get a good meal there, as multiple individuals would all be vouching for it.

⭐ They demonstrate your popularity
This is how Google views backlinks as votes of popularity for a website or webpage, and there is a strong correlation between those with a higher number of links pointing to them and higher rankings.

The general consensus is .... that SEO relates to organic search, and SEM is paid 💥 As simple as that!

Let's look at these two tactics in a little more detail.

Both SEO and SEM:

✔️ Improve the visibility of your website on the search engines, and will help your site show in the SERPs through the use of targeting and optimizing for keywords.

✔️ Both strategies encourage users to click through to your site — albeit one is a paid tactic, the other is organic.

✔️ Both require keyword research to understand what your competition is targeting.

✔️ Both require continuous monitoring and tweaking to be successful long-term and deliver a solid ROI.

SEM vs. SEO: What are the differences?

⭕ Organic results and paid results look different. You can distinguish a paid placement in the SERPs by the ""Ad"" icon. Organic listings don't have this. 

⭕ You pay for every single click or impression with SEM, but you don't pay anything when a user clicks on an organic listing that ranked due to SEO. 

⭕ SEM can drive almost immediate results. SEO can't.

⭕ SEO continues to add value over time, and the return on your investment should be cumulative. For SEM it's not the case, as soon as you turn your ads off your visibility will stop.

⭕ SEM is easier to test and refine than SEO.

It is important that you understand the purpose of each of these as part of your wider marketing strategy and figure out how to use both of these together to drive success and gain a competitive advantage 😉

They are used used to forward website visitors & search engines from one page to another. The most commonly used type of redirects is HTTP redirects 🔒

Difficulties usually begin when you need to understand the differences between HTTP redirects types.

Below you can find details on each type + a simple flowchart that will help you to understand when you should use each of them👇

♻️ 301 Redirects (Moved Permanently) → indicates that the original URL's content has permanently moved to a new URL.

♻️ 302 Redirects (Found & Moved Temporarily) → forwards a user from page A to page B + signals that this move is only temporary and that the original URL will be reinstated.

These are the two most common types of redirect, but there are other variants that you may come across:

♻️* 303 (See Other) → can be used to indicate that the redirects don't link to the newly uploaded resources, but to another page (such as a confirmation page or an upload progress page). 

♻️*307 (Moved Temporarily) → similar to a 302, a 307 redirect is it's HTTP 1.1 equivalent and can be used when a URL needs to be temporarily redirected, but it is believed that 307s do not pass PageRank, and, for this reason, these should be avoided if at all possible and 302s used.

♻️* 308 (Moved Permanently) →  the permanent equivalent of a 307 and, for the same reasons, should be avoided where possible from an SEO perspective. Stick to using 301s whenever you can.

However, plenty of advertisers struggle to get the results they want 🤷‍♂️ 
Let's take a look at signs that can indicate issues with your ads and possible ways on how to address them.

⚠️Your ad hasn’t had any results for the past three days.
🔧 If your reach/ad spend is low → expand your audience, potentially reducing the number of particularly narrow targeting criteria. 

🔧  If your reach & ad spend are fine → take a look at your audience's behavior through GA (check: BR, time on page, exit rate). These metrics will indicate whether or not you are targeting the most appropriate audience.

🔧 Make sure that the link is working and that the landing page matches the content of the ad.

⚠️ Fewer than 1,000 people saw the ad the day before.
🔧 Increase the budget.
🔧 Modify the creative.
🔧 If you are using manual bidding, you may have set a bid cap that is too low.

⚠️ Cost per Result increased over the past seven days 
🔧 Reduce the daily budget of each individual ad campaign that has a high customer acquisition cost (CAC). 

🔧  Identify why the costs went up: were there changes in the audience or the ad campaign itself? Did you pause any other ads in the overall funnel? Was your frequency getting too high, or were customers hiding your ad? 

⚠️ People see the same ad too often 
🔧 Set the frequency rule: < 3 to avoid ad fatigue.
🔧  Change your creative more often to present your audience with new campaigns.
🔧 Expand your audience to reach more people.

⚠️ You spent less than 70% of your daily budget 
🔧 Check the limit on new payment methods that is preventing you from being billed correctly.
🔧 Submit a request to Facebook to increase your threshold.
🔧 Check if you reached the account spending limit.
🔧 Consider switching to automatic bidding, or at least increasing your manual bid.

By targeting long-tail keywords instead of head keywords, you are more likely to bring in visitors who are interested in your site, product, or service for a couple of reasons:

🔑 First and foremost, it is easier to rank for long-tail keywords. There is a ton of competition for common head keywords, but much less for specific long-tail keywords. For instance, it is hard to rank for “sushi,” but easier to rank for “vegan sushi restaurant Chicago.”

🔑 More Targeted Audience. Because long-tail keywords tend to be very specific, someone who searches for one is probably ready to make a purchase or commitment. They already know what they want; they just need to find it.

🔑 Less Expensive Advertising. Competitive keywords tend to have a high cost per click, but keywords with a lower search volume are both cheaper and more targeted.

Marketing has long since moved on from a “spray and pray” approach. Today campaigns are often surgically targeted, planned, and tracked, but many marketers aren’t confident about how to measure the effects of their efforts. Are you among them?

Here are 4 simple rules for the road when determining how you are going to measure content marketing success 👇

🏆 Understand what constitutes success: KPIs and ROI

Create your own scoring system for the KPIs that matter most to YOU. As basic as this may sound, according to @cmicontent, only 65% of marketers have decided on the content marketing success metrics or KPIs, that they will be referencing to determine success. 

📊 Select your marketing metrics with care

For each metric, ask if it will support your key goals and enable you to act. Track conversions, but most of all, track actionable (!) metrics – the ones that give you the information you can use to optimize activity over time.

⭐ Set Benchmarks

Always remember that success is relative. a) You need to know how you are performing at a given point in time so that you can see if you are improving or sustaining losses. b)While industry-wide benchmarks don’t necessarily paint any kind of useful picture, it can be a good idea to set benchmarks against your company’s top rivals

🤔 Measure the Unmeasurable

No matter how hard you try, some content marketing efforts can’t be fully tracked. Nonetheless, you can and should measure those aspects that can reveal the extent to which you are making progress or impacting growth.

Earned media, for example, is often one of those blind spots. Mentions from contributors, or publishing guest posts can be valuable for boosting your reach and bringing you to new audiences, but since they don’t live on your company’s servers, they can be hard to measure.

---
No one said that measuring content marketing success would be easy, but it is achievable when you combine the right tactics!

Research has shown that having the keyword in the body of the meta description is a relevancy signal for search engines that can help your rankings 📈

It isn’t a huge signal, but it can certainly play a positive role if used naturally without keyword stuffing your descriptions.

In terms of your search result, your meta description has the most real estate (two lines of text compared to one line for the title and one line for URL), so take advantage of the opportunity to sell your website with a meaningful message to searchers.

We outlined 6 simple but useful meta description best practices that can help you to encourage clicks and bring visitors from search to your website 🔥

🔹There is no real way to “prove” your SEO skills; it’s about critical thinking and problem solving.
🔹You must have an interviewer that knows SEO in order to hire a good SEO.
🔹Hire an intelligent person who won't let you down.
🔹Look for references, ask for case studies, and look for white hat tactics.
🔹Give them a test project to manage with a keyword or keyword set that you want to improve on. They must have a technical background, a #marketing background and the skill set to work across any #website platform and achieve success.
🔹Transparency: no good SEO should ever worry about showing what they have done for others. Look for a candidate who is willing to learn.

More than one CTA will distract/confuse.

Write helpful content that answers questions/pain points. ❇Choose your keywords wisely! No one cares how much traffic a word generates; if it's not relevant, users won’t stay. ❇Solve a problem. ❇Implementing proper technical SEO and capitalizing on UX is vital for decreasing bounce rates.
❇Personalization also helps with bounce rate.

Provide a fresh sitemap for the new site for Google to crawl and index. 📌 Keep the old XML sitemap live for a month or so to allow Google to quickly find your 301 redirects. 📌 Eliminate as many 404s on the new site as possible with architecture planning and 301s. 📌 Use Search Console to check for crawl errors. 📌 Check your robots.txt. 📌 A lot of times businesses forget to update their email address before hand, make sure if changing domains your customers know! 📌 MAKE SURE you don’t forget to remove “no crawl”. #seo #seotips #searchengine #google"
